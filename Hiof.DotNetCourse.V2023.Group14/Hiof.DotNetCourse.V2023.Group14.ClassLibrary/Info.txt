This is our class library that holds models for classes that will be used by different projects/services.
If you're having trouble finding or importing the models here, make sure that the project you are currently in refers to this ClassLibrary project.
This is done by right clicking on your current project, selecting 'Add', and then selecting 'Project Reference'. Make sure that Hiof.DotNetCourse.V2023.Group14.ClassLibrary is selected, then click Ok.
