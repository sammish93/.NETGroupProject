When testing, make sure to divide tests into three separate stages:
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

Example:

[Fact]
public async Task ExampleTest()
{
	// Stage 1: arrange the variables and instances
	var user = new User("sam", "davies");
	var strToAdd = "sam@samland.no";

	// Stage 2: act on those variables and instances
	user.Email = strToAdd;

	// Stage 3: assert that the results from stage 2 produced the desired effects
	Assert.Equal(strToAdd, user.Email);
}
